# üèóÔ∏è Mixtral‚ÄØ8x7B ‚Äî Senior Architect & Security Reviews

## üìÑ Overview
Mixtral‚ÄØ8x7B is a Mixture‚Äëof‚ÄëExperts (MoE) model with a ~32K token context window, making it ideal for:
- Multi‚Äëfile code reviews
- Architectural risk assessment
- Security audits
- Design improvement suggestions

**Strengths:**
- **Long context window (~32K tokens)** ‚Äî can review multiple files or entire modules at once.
- **Mixture‚Äëof‚ÄëExperts architecture** ‚Äî routes queries to specialized experts for efficiency and quality.
- **Balanced tone** ‚Äî produces structured, actionable feedback without excessive verbosity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### 1. Pull the Model
~~~bash
ollama pull mixtral:8x7b
~~~

### 2. Continue Config Snippet
~~~yaml
- name: mixtral8x7b
  provider: ollama
  model: mixtral:8x7b
  api_base: http://localhost:11434
  roles: [chat]
~~~

### 3. Recommended Defaults
~~~yaml
default_model: codellama7b
default_chat_model: codellama13b
~~~
‚Ä¶and switch to Mixtral when you need deep reviews.

## üõ† Usage Workflow

### When to Use Mixtral
- **Architect Review:** Identify design flaws, maintainability issues, and improvement opportunities.
- **Security Audit:** Spot vulnerabilities, insecure patterns, and missing best practices.

### Switching in Continue
1. Open the Continue sidebar in VS‚ÄØCode.
2. Select **Mixtral 8x7B** from the model picker.
3. Apply one of the reusable prompts below.

## üß© Reusable Prompts

### Architect Review
~~~text
Review this code as a senior software architect. Identify architectural risks, maintainability issues, and suggest improvements with rationale.
~~~

### Security Audit
~~~text
Review this code as a senior security engineer. Identify potential vulnerabilities, insecure coding patterns, and areas where security best practices are not followed. Suggest specific mitigations and explain the reasoning behind each recommendation.
~~~

## üîÑ Optional Enhancements

### Add to Continue Prompts
~~~yaml
prompts:
  - name: architect-review
    description: Full code review from a senior architect perspective
    prompt: |
      Review this code as a senior software architect. Identify architectural risks, maintainability issues, and suggest improvements with rationale.

  - name: security-audit
    description: Security-focused review of code for vulnerabilities and best practices
    prompt: |
      Review this code as a senior security engineer. Identify potential vulnerabilities, insecure coding patterns, and areas where security best practices are not followed. Suggest specific mitigations and explain the reasoning behind each recommendation.

  - name: performance-optimization
    description: Analyze code for performance bottlenecks and suggest optimizations
    prompt: |
      Review this code for performance issues. Identify bottlenecks, inefficient algorithms, and unnecessary resource usage. Suggest specific optimizations and explain the trade-offs.

  - name: maintainability-check
    description: Evaluate code for maintainability and long-term sustainability
    prompt: |
      Review this code for maintainability. Identify areas that may be difficult to update, extend, or debug in the future. Suggest improvements to structure, naming, and documentation.

  - name: compliance-review
    description: Check code for compliance with industry standards or internal guidelines
    prompt: |
      Review this code for compliance with the specified standards or guidelines. Identify violations and suggest corrections.

  - name: test-coverage-review
    description: Assess test coverage and suggest additional tests
    prompt: |
      Review the provided code and its associated tests. Identify missing test cases, edge cases, and scenarios that should be covered. Suggest improvements to test quality and coverage.

### Feed Multiple Files or Modules
- Use Continue‚Äôs **multi‚Äëfile selection** to send related files together.
- For very large projects, break reviews into logical modules.

### Autocomplete Experimentation
While Mixtral is for deep reviews, you can experiment with:
- `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` ‚Äî fastest completions
- `starcoder2:3b` ‚Äî richer completions
- `deepseek-coder:6.7b-base` ‚Äî highest quality completions

See `/home/brent/reference-guides/ai-coding-models.md` for full model role mapping.

## üìå Notes

- Mixtral is heavier than CodeLlama models ‚Äî use it for **periodic deep reviews**, not constant inline completions.
- Combine with `/home/brent/dev/tools/keep-awake.sh` for long review sessions.
- Keep prompts concise and focused for best results.
- For autocomplete experimentation, see also:
  - `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` ‚Äî fastest completions
  - `starcoder2:3b` ‚Äî richer completions
  - `deepseek-coder:6.7b-base` ‚Äî highest quality completions
- See `/home/brent/reference-guides/ai-coding-models.md` for the full model role mapping and hardware fit table.
