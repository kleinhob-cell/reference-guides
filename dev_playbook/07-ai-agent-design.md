# f916 AI Agent Design

This section outlines strategies and architecture for designing AI agents using local models, LangChain, and VS Code integration. It includes modular design principles, tool chaining, and memory management.

---

## f4a1 Design Philosophy

- Build agents as modular, composable systems
- Use local models for privacy and performance
- Integrate agents into development tools (e.g., VS Code)
- Benchmark against GitHub Copilot Pro

---

## f4bb Core Components

### 1. Task Modules
- Calendar integration
- Meeting summarization
- Prompt generation

### 2. Tool Interfaces
- LangChain tools for API calls, file access, and logic
- Ollama models for local inference

### 3. Memory Systems
- Short-term memory for session context
- Long-term memory for persistent knowledge

---

## f4c8 Architecture Overview

Use LangChain to:
- Chain tools and models together
- Define agent behavior and responses
- Manage context and memory

### Example:
```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.llms import Ollama

llm = Ollama(model="codellama")
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent_type="zero-shot")
```

---

## f4da VS Code Integration

- Embed agent into VS Code using extensions
- Use terminal commands or chat interface
- Enable prompt-driven workflows and automation

---

## f4cc Recommendations

- Maintain a `/agents` folder with agent configs and modules
- Document each tool and memory strategy
- Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize agent workflows
