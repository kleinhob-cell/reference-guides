# üß† Model Selection

This section outlines how to choose the right AI models for your development tasks, including local models via Ollama and cloud-based options like OpenAI.

---

## üéØ Selection Philosophy

- Choose models based on task complexity, latency, and privacy
- Prefer local models for fast iteration and secure data handling
- Use cloud models for advanced reasoning and large-scale tasks

---

## üß© Model Categories

### 1. Code Generation
- `codellama` (local via Ollama)
- `code-davinci-002` (OpenAI)

### 2. General Reasoning
- `llama2` (local)
- `gpt-4` (OpenAI)
- `mistral` (local)

### 3. Summarization & NLP
- `llama2` fine-tuned
- `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- `mistral` with RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)

## üñ•Ô∏è Local vs Cloud Models

| Criteria         | Local Models (Ollama) | Cloud Models (OpenAI) |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Latency          | ‚úÖ Fast                | ‚ö†Ô∏è Variable            |
| Privacy          | ‚úÖ High                | ‚ö†Ô∏è Depends on provider |
| Cost             | ‚úÖ Free (after setup)  | ‚ö†Ô∏è Subscription-based  |
| Capabilities     | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited context     | ‚úÖ Advanced reasoning  |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration Tips

- Use Ollama to host models locally
- Use LangChain to abstract model calls
- Benchmark models using the same tasks

### Example:
```python
from langchain.llms import Ollama
llm = Ollama(model="codellama")
response = llm("Summarize this meeting transcript")
```

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

- Maintain a `/models` folder with config and usage notes
- Document model performance and limitations
- Use prompt libraries to test model behavior
