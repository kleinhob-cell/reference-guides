# üß† AI Development Workflow Manual

Welcome to my AI Development Workflow Manual ‚Äî a living guide documenting my journey from no-code to low-code AI development. This manual is designed to be both a personal learning companion and a shareable playbook for building intelligent applications using modern tools like GitHub Copilot Pro, Ollama, LangChain, and more.

---

## üéØ Purpose

This manual serves three core purposes:

1. **Learning Companion**  
   Documenting every step of my transition from no-code to low-code development, with detailed explanations, prompts, and workflows.

2. **Development Playbook**  
   Capturing reusable patterns, best practices, and modular references for building AI-powered applications.

3. **Benchmarking & Innovation**  
   Using GitHub Copilot Pro as the benchmark, I aim to build my own AI Developer Agent that integrates into VS Code and eventually surpasses Copilot in usability and quality.

## üß≠ Development Environment

- **Primary Workstation**: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS  
  - AMD Ryzen 7 9700X, AMD RX 7900 XTX (ROCm-enabled), dual NVMe storage  
  - VS Code with GitHub Copilot Pro  
  - Ollama for local model hosting  
  - LangChain and LlamaIndex for agent design

- **Remote Access**: MacBook Pro  
  - Connected via VS Code SSH Remote  
  - Future goal: full remote desktop access to Ubuntu workstation

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Style

- **Starting Point**: No-code development  
- **Goal**: Evolve into low-code workflows using AI-assisted tools  
- **Primary Assistant**: GitHub Copilot Pro  
- **Long-Term Vision**: Build a custom AI Dev Agent integrated into VS Code

---

## üì¶ Initial Projects

The manual will document multiple AI-based applications, starting with:

1. **Meeting Assistant** *(priority project)*  
   - Full system design manual already created  
   - Will be the first implementation and testbed for the workflow

2. **Calendar Agent**  
3. **Smart Home Automation**  
4. **Interactive Family Calendar**  
5. **IoT Integrations**  
6. **Personal Assistant**

Each project will have its own section with architecture, workflows, and learnings.

## üìö Manual Format

- **Markdown-based GitHub repository**  
- **Narrative guide style** with embedded modular references  
- **Modular reference files** for:
  - Prompt templates  
  - Tool setup guides  
  - Architecture diagrams  
  - Reusable code snippets  
  - Learning journal entries

---

## üîÑ Workflow Philosophy

- Agile mindset with iterative development  
- Document-as-you-go approach  
- Emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and shareability  
- Continuous benchmarking against GitHub Copilot Pro

---

## üìå What's Next?

We‚Äôll begin with:
- Setting up the development environment
- Creating the first project scaffold
- Writing and refining prompts for Copilot
- Building and documenting the Meeting Assistant

Let‚Äôs get started.
