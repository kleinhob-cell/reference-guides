# 🚀 Deployment and Ops

This section outlines strategies for deploying AI-based applications and managing operations, including local hosting, remote access, and automation.

---

## 🧠 Deployment Philosophy

- Start with local deployment for fast iteration
- Use remote access for flexibility and scalability
- Automate setup and updates with scripts and containers

---

## 🖥️ Local Deployment

- Use Python scripts and VS Code for local testing
- Host models with Ollama on Ubuntu workstation
- Run agents and services via terminal or task runners

### Example:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

---

## 🌐 Remote Access

- Connect via VS Code SSH Remote from MacBook Pro
- Future goal: full remote desktop access
- Use secure SSH keys and firewall rules

### Example:
```bash
ssh user@your-ubuntu-ip
```

---

## 🐳 Containerization (Optional)

- Use Docker to package and run services
- Create Dockerfiles for reproducible environments
- Use `docker-compose` for multi-service orchestration

### Example Dockerfile:
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "src/main.py"]
```

---

## 🔁 Automation

- Use Makefiles or shell scripts for common tasks
- Automate testing, deployment, and updates

### Example Makefile:
```Makefile
run:
	python src/main.py

test:
	pytest tests/
```

---

## 📈 Monitoring and Logging

- Use Python `logging` module for diagnostics
- Track performance and errors
- Document known issues and resolutions

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Maintain a `/deployment` folder with scripts and configs
- Document setup steps and troubleshooting tips
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD if needed
