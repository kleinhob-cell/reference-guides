# ðŸ§© Low-Code Patterns

This section outlines reusable patterns and strategies for low-code AI development using GitHub Copilot Pro, local models, and modular design principles.

---

## ðŸ§  Philosophy

- Start with no-code tools and evolve into low-code workflows
- Use AI assistants to scaffold, generate, and refactor code
- Focus on modularity, reusability, and clarity

---

## ðŸ§° Common Low-Code Patterns

### 1. Function Templates
Use Copilot to generate reusable function templates:
```python
# Summarize meeting transcript using local LLM
```

### 2. Modular File Structure
Organize code into logical modules:
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ calendar.py
â”œâ”€â”€ summarizer.py
â””â”€â”€ assistant.py
```

### 3. Prompt-Driven Development
Use prompts to drive code generation:
```text
"Create a class that manages calendar events and integrates with Google Calendar API."
```

### 4. Copilot Refactoring
Use Copilot Chat to:
- Refactor large functions
- Split logic into smaller components
- Improve readability and performance

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing Patterns

- Use Copilot to generate unit tests for each module
- Maintain a `/tests` folder with descriptive test cases
- Validate edge cases and error handling

---

## ðŸ§  AI Agent Patterns

- Use LangChain for chaining tasks and tools
- Use Ollama for local model inference
- Design agents with modular tools and memory

### Example:
```python
# Agent that summarizes meetings and updates calendar
```

---

## âœ… Recommendations

- Maintain a `/patterns` folder with reusable code snippets
- Document each pattern with purpose and usage
- Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize workflows
